      location: "15 locations across three states",
      patients: "45,000+ patients",
      status: "Verified Client",
      challenge: "This growing dental group was losing significant revenue from missed calls. With front desk staff overwhelmed by phone volume, they were missing 35% of incoming calls across all locations. Each missed call represented potential revenue loss, and patients were frustrated by busy signals and long hold times. The group estimated they were losing $150,000+ annually from missed opportunities alone.",
      solution: "They implemented an AI receptionist system across all 15 locations, integrated with their existing practice management software. The AI was trained on their specific scheduling rules, insurance policies, and common patient questions. It handled appointment scheduling, insurance verification, and basic inquiries 24/7, while seamlessly transferring complex cases to human staff.",

      testimonial: "Within the first month, we booked over $56,000 worth of new patient appointments that would have been missed calls. Missed calls dropped by 80%, and our front desk staff saved 2 hours daily per location. The group saw a 12% increase in overall revenue and reduced front desk staffing needs by 17% while improving patient satisfaction scores.",

      location: "Single location",
      patients: "8,000 patients",
      status: "Verified Client",
      challenge: "This family practice was struggling with high no-show rates (28%) and missed after-hours calls. Patients frequently called outside business hours for urgent concerns and appointment requests, but could only reach voicemail. The practice was losing potential patients to competitors with better availability, and no-shows were costing them approximately $4,200 monthly in unused appointment slots.",
      solution: "They deployed an AI receptionist with 24/7 availability and intelligent appointment reminder system. The AI handled after-hours scheduling, sent personalized SMS reminders with easy reschedule options, and answered common patient questions about services, directions, and insurance. It also prioritized urgent calls and facilitated same-day appointments for pressing medical needs.",

      testimonial: "Within three months, new patient bookings increased by 15%, with most new appointments coming from after-hours calls that previously went to voicemail. No-show rates dropped from 28% to 8% due to automated reminders and easy rescheduling. The practice recovered $3,400 monthly from reduced no-shows and gained $8,500 in additional monthly revenue from new bookings.",

      challenge: "Technicians were constantly interrupted by phone calls for estimates and scheduling, reducing productivity and delaying repairs. The shop was missing 30% of incoming calls during peak hours, losing potential customers to competitors. Each missed call represented lost revenue, and customers were frustrated by having to call multiple times to reach someone.",
      solution: "Deployed Auralyn AI to handle estimate requests, schedule drop-offs, and manage customer communications. The AI was trained on their specific services, pricing structure, and scheduling availability. It could provide initial estimates, schedule appointments, and answer common questions about insurance claims and repair timelines.",
